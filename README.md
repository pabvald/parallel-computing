# Parallel computing practise with OpenMP, MPICH and CUDA 

This repository contains the practice carried out in the subject 'Parallel Computing'. I was provided me with a C program that simulates a fire extinguishing system (<a href="https://github.com/pabvald/parallel_computing/tree/master/original">see original code</a>) and I implemented a parallel version of this same program using:


- <a href="https://github.com/pabvald/parallel_computing/tree/master/openmp">OpenMP</a> 
- <a href="https://github.com/pabvald/parallel_computing/tree/master/mpich">MPICH</a> 
- <a href="https://github.com/pabvald/parallel_computing/tree/master/cuda">CUDA</a>
